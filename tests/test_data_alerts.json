Currently, the center of the circulation is located in southern DeWitt County and is moving to the southeast at 2 mph. Our life-threatening flood event continues east of the I-35 corridor and Flash Flood Warnings have been issued. Over a foot of rain has fallen from Bastrop and Caldwell counties, southeast to Bay City over the last 48 hours. Multiple water rescues, road closures, evacuated homes, and stalled vehicles have been reported across both Bastrop and Caldwell Counties. Additional rainfall totals of 10-15 inches with isolated areas of 20+ inches are still anticipated in these areas, which will likely worsen the flooding in these already impacted areas. Across Travis County, including the city of Austin, two to eight inches of rain has fallen in the last 48 hours with an additional four to eight anticipated through Wednesday. The city of San Antonio has been bisected by the heavy rainfall, being on the western extent of the rain shield. Eastern areas have seen a little over three inches of rainfall where western areas have seen less than an inch. Two to four inches of additional rainfall is forecast for the city through Wednesday. Winds will gust to 40-50 mph today in the area under the tropical storm warning. Elsewhere wind gusts will be 30-40 mph. POTENTIAL IMPACTS ----------------- * FLOODING RAIN: Potential impacts from the flooding rain are still unfolding across the area east of I-35 and I-37. Remain well guarded against life- threatening flood waters having additional devastating impacts. If realized, these impacts include: - Extreme rainfall flooding may prompt numerous evacuations and rescues. - Rivers and tributaries may overwhelmingly overflow their banks in many places with deep moving water. Small streams, creeks, canals, arroyos, and ditches may become raging rivers. In mountain areas, deadly runoff may rage down valleys while increasing susceptibility to rockslides and mudslides. Flood control systems and barriers may become stressed. - Flood waters can enter numerous structures within multiple communities, some structures becoming uninhabitable or washed away. Numerous places where flood waters may cover escape routes. Streets and parking lots become rivers of raging water with underpasses submerged. Driving conditions become very dangerous. Numerous road and bridge closures with some weakened or washed out. Elsewhere across SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS, minor impacts are anticipated along I-35 between San Antonio and Austin. * WIND: Potential impacts from the main wind event are now unfolding across the area under the tropical storm warning. Remain well sheltered from hazardous wind having additional limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include: - Damage to porches, awnings, carports, sheds, and unanchored mobile homes. Unsecured lightweight objects blown about. - Many large tree limbs broken off. A few trees snapped or uprooted, but with greater numbers in places where trees are shallow rooted. Some fences and roadway signs blown over. - A few roads impassable from debris, particularly within urban or heavily wooded places. Hazardous driving conditions on bridges and other elevated roadways. - Scattered power and communications outages. Elsewhere across SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS, little to no impact is anticipated. * TORNADOES: Potential impacts from tornadoes are still unfolding across the area east of Hwy 77. Remain well braced against a tornado event having possible limited impacts. If realized, these impacts include: - The occurrence of isolated tornadoes can hinder the execution of emergency plans during tropical events. - A few places may experience tornado damage, along with power and communications disruptions. - Locations could realize roofs peeled off buildings, chimneys toppled, mobile homes pushed off foundations or overturned, large tree tops and branches snapped off, shallow-rooted trees knocked over, moving vehicles blown off roads, and small boats pulled from moorings. Elsewhere across SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS, little to no impact is anticipated. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS ---------------------------------- * OTHER PREPAREDNESS INFORMATION: Now is the time to remain safely sheltered from the storm. Stay inside and away from windows. Listen for updates and be ready in case you lose electrical power. Locate your battery powered radio and flashlight from your Emergency Supplies Kit. Keep these items close. Continue to keep your cell phone well charged for as long as possible. If you lose power, use it more sparingly and mainly for personal emergencies and check-ins. Do not overload communications systems with idle chatter. Do not be a thrill seeker or risk your life for senseless photos or videos. Be wise and avoid becoming another statistic. Be ready to move to the identified safe room if your home or shelter begins to fail. Quickly move to an interior room on the lowest floor. Put as many sturdy walls between you and the storm as you can. Protect your head and body. * ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INFORMATION: - For information on appropriate preparations see ready.gov - For information on creating an emergency plan see getagameplan.org - For additional disaster preparedness information see redcross.org NEXT UPDATE ----------- The next local statement will be issued by the National Weather Service in Austin/San Antonio TX around 4 PM CDT, or sooner if conditions warrant.\n","uri":"https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/wwacapget.php?x=TX125862FD2D58.HurricaneLocalStatement.12586309FEFCTX.EWXHLSEWX.adcd3f7defb232a513c13c6bf2962472"},{"title":"Wind Advisory","regions":["Lee","Travis","Williamson"],"severity":"advisory","time":1503829200,"expires":1503867600,"description":"...WIND ADVISORY NOW IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 PM CDT THIS AFTERNOON... * TIMING...Through 4 PM. * WINDS...Sustained winds of 25 to 35 mph with gusts to 40 mph. * IMPACTS...Driving high profile vehicles will be difficult through the day.
